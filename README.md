# Convolutional-neural-network-for-MNIST
 I implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). I also write my own code for convolutions (e.g., do not use SciPy's convolution function). The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. It should achieve at least 96% accuracy on the Test Set.
